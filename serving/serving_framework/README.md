# Vertex AI `predict` support

This directory contains source code to help implement a container that satisfies Vertex AI's
[custom prediction container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements)
so that it can be deployed to be called through the
[predict method](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.endpoints/predict).
