# Derm Foundation Notebooks

**Notebooks in this folder:**

*   [Quick start with Hugging Face](quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Example of encoding a dermatology image into an embedding vector by running
    the model locally from Hugging Face.

*   [Quick start with Vertex Model Garden](quick_start_with_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Example of serving the model on
    [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview)
    and using Vertex AI APIs to encode dermatology images to embeddings in
    online or batch workflows.

*   [Train a data efficient classifier](train_data_efficient_classifier.ipynb) -
    Example of using the generated embeddings to train a custom classifier with
    less data and compute.

**Notebooks from the community:**

*   [DERM12345 Embeddings and Demo](https://github.com/abdurrahimyilmaz/derm12345_google-derm-foundation/tree/main) - Demo using Derm Foundation precomputed embeddings for [DERM12345](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04104-3). Special thanks to Abdurrahim Yilmaz for providing this.
