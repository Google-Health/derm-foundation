# Derm Foundation

Derm Foundation is a machine learning (ML) model that produces embeddings based
on dermatology images. The embeddings can be used to
[efficiently build AI models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning)
for dermatology image related tasks, requiring less data and less compute than
having to fully train a model without the embeddings.

As a Health AI Developer Foundations model trained on large scale datasets, Derm
Foundation helps businesses and institutions in healthcare and life sciences do
more with their dermatology data with less data, accelerating their ability to
build AI models for dermatology image analysis.

## Get started

*   Explore this repository, which contains [notebooks](./notebooks) for using
    the model from Vertex AI as well as the [implementation](./serving) of the
    container that you can deploy to Vertex AI.

*   Visit the model on
    [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/derm-foundation).
